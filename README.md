This course aims to teach students data science concepts and machine learning methods for solving
problems and gaining insights in real-world settings. In order to apply the concepts to practice, the
students will be working on the following midterm project as one large component of this class.
Students will work in groups of two to four students to practice completing the project.
This home dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes
homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

The goal is to predict the sales price for each house based on the given features. For each Id in the
test set, you must predict the value of the price variable and submit your results on Canvas by 7PM
on 11/03. You need to submit a csv file with two columns: ID in the test set and the predicted sales
price.
